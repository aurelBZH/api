## Development Guidelines

** Git Structure

 * This project uses the Git Flow methodology for code management and development: <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>.

 * This project has two master branches and corresponding develop
   branches to support ongoing V1 and V2 API work. Make sure to
   double-check your branches and merge operations so the two versions
   do not get mixed up.

 * The *v1-master* branch is the master branch for ongoing V1 API
   work, with *v1-develop* as its develop branch.

 * The *master* branch is for ongoing V2 API work, with *develop* as
   its develop branch.

 * New development and features should be done on branches that are
   cloned from the *develop* (for V2) or *v1-develop* (for V1) branch,
   and then merged into this branch when completed.

 * Releases should merge *develop* into *master* (for V2) or
   *v1-develop* into *v1-master* (for V1). Tag *master* or *v1-master*
   *with the appropriate version.
